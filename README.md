This is a caesar cipher written in C. to use it, simply type "encrypt(your string here)" and the program will shift all letters 5 to the right, with remainders 
carrying over to the beginning of the alphabet. 

To decrypt it, type "decrypt(encrypted string)".

The program will also convert a string to binary with "encode(string)", and convert the binary back to text using "decode(binary)".
